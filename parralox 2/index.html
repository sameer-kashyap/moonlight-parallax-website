        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effect</h2>
        <p>
            As people’s attention span is decreasing, it’s getting harder to attract their attention. This is why it’s important to use some tricks to keep them engaged. Using parallax scrolling is one of those tricks.
<br><br>
            What is parallax scrolling? First, let’s define it.
            <br><br>
            Parallax scrolling is a web design technique that is used to enhance user experience. The idea behind the parallax effect is to create an illusion of depth as the background scrolls slower than the foreground. The different scrolling speed of the elements gives the 2D scene an effect similar to 3D.
            <br><br>
            The parallax effect can be used for different purposes: improve user experience, facilitate the scrolling process, draw attention to specific website sections, support the content, introduce a product/service, highlight a special offer, etc.
            <br>
            Even though the parallax effect is not a new technique, it continues to be a trend due to its effectiveness. This effect provides users with a smooth scrolling experience which encourages them to stay longer on the site and explore it. 
            <br><br>

Parallax scrolling is a complex effect. Many different factors may affect its overall performance and effectiveness. Here are some of them:
<ul>
    <h3>Wrong layer timing may ruin the impression of the parallax effect. </h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Website load speed can affect the parallax scrolling</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>The parallax effect works for specific types of content</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Complicated animations may frustrate the visitors</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Too much scrolling can have a negative effect</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Consider mobile-friendliness – optimize the effects</h3>
</ul>
